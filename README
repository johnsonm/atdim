This design for an attiny-based PWM dimmer circuit is licensed under
the CERN OHL as provided in the file cern_ohl_v_1_2.txt

This project requires that you set the open-project library references
to point to a checkout of git@github.com:open-project/kicadlibrary.git
The attiny part included is a variant on the version in the atmel
library with two pins moved for cosmetic purposes.

Options:

P1 may be 0.1" pitch header or screw terminal
Place P2 (ICSP) only if ICSP function desired
Three 4mm mounting holes provided

PHOTOR1 may be a 2-pin 0.1" header to a remote photoresistor
PHOTOR1 and R1 may be omitted if light sensing is not desired

RV1 may be a 0.2" pitch potentiometer, a 0.1" pitch potentiometer,
a 0.1" pitch trim potentiometer, or a 3-conductor 0.1" or 0.2"
pitch connector (header or molex) to a remote potentiometer.
If you are using a 0.1" pitch part, solder the smaller pads first
as the middle pad's through-hole is sized to accomodate the larger
legs on typical 0.2" pitch potentiometers.

R3 is an optional pull-up resistor to ensure that the MOSFET
switches off cleanly at low duty cycle as described in.

ATTINY85-T is any ATTINY*5 through-hole part that can hold your
desired program.

For low-profile applications:
Install ATTINY*5 directly soldered, not in a socket
R3 (if used) installed on the bottom of the board to accomodate flat C2
C2 installed flat, with leads bent, towards C1
U1 (7805) installed with bent leads over flat C2 and R2
Q1 (MOSFET) installed with bent leads over ATTINY*5
